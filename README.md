# html-mac-lookup
JavaScript and html file example for Mac lookup locally.
Found this gem while scraping through html on the web, was trying to add mac lookup to a site couldn't 
find any Resources on how to do it with out an api. but stumbled apon this. It's not mine Obviously.
Just wanted to share this for anyone else wanting something similar. Just copy the html into whatever your working on and point the
<script> to the location you have the manuf.js fild stored. should work just fine.
